The council is elected by the people, the general and the military take after the Huns, Parents are above children, The conqured people that obey become citizens and the ones who rebel become slaves.
Everyone except the small amount of slaves were treated with respect. The people wont rebel because everyone trys to show respect to the leader and the leader says that everyone should be in their own place. The council judges and mostly men serve in the army while women protect their territory.  </center>
