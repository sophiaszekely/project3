 <center><font face="verdana" color="green"><p>Our theory of a civilization is nobody is allowed to step out of their place morally.Eye for an eye tooth for a tooth if you step out of place like mistreating someone of a lower rank then he will be lowered below that rank.if a son or daughter strike their father or mother then they will be strike twice as hard."Let a ruler base his government upon virtuous principles, and he will be like the pole-star, which remains steadfast in its place, while all the host of stars turn towards it.‚Äù once a ruler is elected nobody is able to defy him as it was the people's choice to follow him.If a man (of any rank) accuse a man (of any rank) of a capital crime and it is not true the man he has accused will be his master in the afterlife.
A civilization is prosperous when there is a strong social contract between the council and the people based a virtuous principles</p></font></center>
